# odin-recipes
Hello, my name is Sebastian, and this is my first Odin Project.
This project consists of a basic recipe website, just the HTML, no CSS design yet.
I will put in practice everything I learned so far, which is basic Git, and basic HTML tags. (Also, its my first time using Linux and I'm very excited about it! I want to learn more!!)
See you soon in a future project.
